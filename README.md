# walker

### PURPOSE
Highschool physics lessons were in fact very **interesting**. They may be boring if you are learning to pass the exams, but they are very useful when I try to learn new libraries.

[p5](https://p5js.org/) is an extremely **fun** library for experimenting stuff. It has drawing helpers for easily creating a canvas. You can also work with vectors easily.

In this project, I aim to demonstrate the effects of **maximum velocity** and **acceleration rate** to the movement.
